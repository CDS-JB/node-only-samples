# Creating NodeJS and/or Web programs in Codio

# Check Node is Running

This Codio Project is already set up with NodeJS running.  To test Node open a New Terminal and type the following:

``` 
node -v 
```

The current version of NodeJS installed should then appear eg:

```
v10.21.0
```

# Node Command Prompt

In the terminal window enter the Node command line by typing:

```
node
```

The ```>``` prompt should indicate you are in the Node Command Prompt.

Once in the Node command line Javascript commands such as `console` can be used.  `console` is allows messages to output and is useful for basic debugging.  Make sure you are still in the Node Command Prompt and type:

```
>console.info('Hello command line')
```

.. and your message should appear.

|||info

Note: There is a second undefined because `console.info()` doesn't return a value. This has no impact in this situation.
